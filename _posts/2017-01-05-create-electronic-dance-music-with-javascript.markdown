The new year began with a bang for me. Literally. Thanks to the good folks from [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/) that organize the monthly [SF Node](https://www.meetup.com/sfnode/) meetup, I got an opportunity to speak at the [Github](https://github.com/) HQ about 2 of the things I m most passionate about in life, Music & JavaScript! The event was managed professionally and the sound at Github was just jaw dropping awesome! I had driven there with my modest MOTU audio interface and Yamaha active monitors. When I met the Github counterpart of this event ([Jacob Groundwater](https://github.com/groundwater), Electron product manager) I said to him, "Hey you know I ve got my own sound if you guys don't have good sound, I can just hook up my sound to your system". He said, "I don't think you ll need to do that". And that's about it. I was still a bit apprehensive and somewhat thankful to myself for carrying my sound with me.

When I walked into Github, firstly it was like a fancy 5 star hotel and had a huge bar right at the entrance. The place had an ultra cool urbane vibe and although I didnt get some tour of the place, it sure seemed like a beautiful place to work! Anyway, when I walked into the event area, I was just taken aback to the see the sound setup. It had 8 massive speakers all around and a dedicated, raised, sound engineering booth. I could ve never imagined that! The sound was awesome!

On the SF Node front, I got to meet [Dan Shaw](https://twitter.com/dshaw) in person! He is at the helm of [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/) (the Node that they provide is the one we use at [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home)! He is also the unique voice behind the NodeUp podcast that I listen to on my way to work every day! I didnt know how Dan looked so when he came up to me and spoke to me, I didnt recognize for exactly about one fourth of a second coz as soon as he spoke, I instantly recognized him by his voice! He was most supportive and encouraging and was most generous in his appreciation. He even gave out NodeSource shirts! 2 other folks whom I m indebted to are [Paul Grock](https://github.com/paulgrock) and [Chris Oyler](https://github.com/IAmEddieDean)! These dudes got me this gig and I can't thank them enough...

Anyway, before this starts to turn into a Oscar awards speech, on my way out I got at least a hundred Github stickers which are now adorning my Mac Book Pro. 

And finally, here's the video of this gig (the video was done by a pro video dude - [Matt Fisher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-fisher-50012881/), who put in a lot of effort to put this together and interlaced it with my slides coz my Mac's screen recorder goofed up during the talk!
