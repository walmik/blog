As of EcmaScript 5, closures, along with functions, are at the heart of creating modules in JavaScript. While understanding closures can take some time initially, the effort invested yields great results on the dawn of understanding of what closures are. A “closure” is an expression (typically a function) that returns an object or function along with the environment it was created in, such that it has access to the variables and identifiers from the environment, even after that environment or the function that surrounds (or closes) it, has returned.

In Indian classical music, there is a concept called Raaga. Raaga is like an advanced scale or mode with melody. Using a scale as the means to define a Raaga is like using tap water to explain the concept of rain. But there is really no simpler way to explain this to an audience which comprises of people who may not have ever heard of Raagas!

There are many different Raagas. In many cases, a Raaga is explored in a concert by a vocal artist or instrumentalist with an attempt to invoke in the listeners, the original emotion that was responsible for the birth of the Raaga. To give the listeners the same feeling without giving them the circumstances that caused that feeling.

Awareness of the feeling thru the rendition of a Raaga is the transfer of state(emotion) and data(notes) to the listener. Once the listener is one with the feeling that the artist is trying to express, a perfect closure scenario takes place. The feeling the listener gets is the object returned and the rendition itself is the closure. The same analogy can be easily applied to the other art forms. An artist’s painting is the closure and the disturbance or joy derived by soaking oneself in the artwork is the object returned. No wonder then, we feel nothing sometimes when we look at some of the modern art. That happens when the closure fails to return an object along with it’s environment.

To sum it up, closures give out a function or object that remembers the environment it was created in. The general approach to understanding closures is to get as many different perspectives about it till one of ‘em clicks for you. I hope this abstract comparison to art  and music for explaining closures acts as yet another perspective about closures. Happy coding!
