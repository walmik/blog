I m happy to post about my first ever jQuery plugin. This plugin will allow you to add a simple timer to a HTML element like a DIV or INPUT or any other valid display element. You can style this element to show the timer the way you like. It is really easy to use this plugin. Make sure you have jQuery referenced in your page followed by the timer plugin itself. Here's a simple way to get a timer running inside a DIV that has the id of 'mytime':

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#mydiv').timer('start');
{% endhighlight %}

There's a lot more to this plugin and you can learn more about it on it's [dedicated website](http://jquerytimer.com "jQuery Timer")
