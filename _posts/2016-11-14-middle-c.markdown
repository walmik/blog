excerpt: MIDI specifications define middle C as the number 60. It does not state if this is on the third or the fourth octave. It just says, if you want a middle C, it will numerically be 60 from MIDI's point of view.

MIDI specifications define middle C as the number 60. It does not state if this is on the third or the fourth octave. It just says, if you want a middle C, it will numerically be 60 from MIDI's point of view. Device manufacturers (and software creators) are free to set whichever octave they want to the number 60. Here's how various devices and softwares treat the number 60, in effect the middle C:

| Software/Hardware       | Middle C |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Ableton Live            | C3       |
| Propellerhead Reason    | C3       |
| Steinberg Cubase        | C3       |
| Logic Audio             | C3       |
| Garage Band             | C3       |
| Yamaha MIDI Keyboards   | C3       |
| Roland MIDI Keyboards   | C4       |
| Kurzweil MIDI Keyboards | C4       |
| JS Midgen               | C4       |
| Scribbletune            | C4       |


[Scribbletune](https://www.scribbletune.com) also uses C4 as middle C (because it's primary dependency - JS Midgen - does that)

Technically, if we consider [0 as the first octave and 10 as the last one](http://www.electronics.dit.ie/staff/tscarff/Music_technology/midi/midi_note_numbers_for_octaves.htm), then C5 should be middle C. Softwares such as Ableton Live & Properllerhead Reason, transpose this setting to -2 (lowest note C -2) to 8 (highest not G# 8) hence on these, middle C is C3.

If you don't plan to record MIDI and are just interested in playing the keyboard/piano you have, then the middle C is the C of the middle octave of your keyboard.
